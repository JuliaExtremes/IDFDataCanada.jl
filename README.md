A set of methods to get ECCC IDF data from .txt files.

## Overview

Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) data from Engineering Climate Datasets of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) are available for download in .txt format, a format that can be less convinient to use. IDFDataCanada.jl offers methods to get ECCC IDF data in NetCDF (.nc) or CSV (.csv) format automatically from the .txt files from ECCC's [server](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Engineer_Climate/IDF/).

## Required dependencies 

### Julia dependencies

* CSV
* DataFrames
* NCDatasets

### Command-line utilities

* unzip

## Getting started

### Installation

*IDFDataCanada* is now a registered package. It can be installed using  Julia's builtin package manager:

```julia
Pkg> add IDFDataCanada
```

### Extract data

The key feature of *IDFDataCanada* is the `data_download` function. It can be used directly by providing the province code (ex: `"QC"` for Quebec), the output directory (must be an existing folder) and the format (`CSV` or `netCDF`). By default, `CSV` format is selected and all provinces will be downloaded if no province code is provided. The two keyword arguments, `split` and `rm_temp`, can be set to extract data in a subfolder for each province or to keep the temporarily downloaded zip files. To download more than one province at the time, an array of province codes can by used (ex: `["QC", "ON"]` for Quebec and Ontario).

```julia
data_download(output_dir::String, province::String="all", format::String="csv"; split::Bool=false, rm_temp::Bool=true)
data_download(output_dir::String, provinces::Array{String,N} where N, format::String="csv"; split::Bool=false, rm_temp::Bool=true)
```

`data_download` will create output files of the specified format in the output directory and a CSV a file containing station information named `info_stations.csv`.


### Format

#### CSV

By choosing CSV format, it will return a CSV file for each station of the selected province with ECCC Short Duration Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Data from Table 1: Annual Maximum (mm).

|AnnÃ©e  |5min   |10min  |15min  |30min  |1h      |2h      |6h    |12h   |24h   |
|:-----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|-----:|
|      |       Â |        |        |        |         |         |       |       |      |

Station informations for all the province are returned in a CSV file named info_stations_{PROVINCE_CODE}.csv :

|Name  |Province|ID      |Lat     |Lon     |Elevation|Number of years|CSV filename|Original filename|
|:-----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:----------:|----------------:|
|      |       Â |        |        |        |         |               |            |                 |

#### NetCDF (update needed)

By choosing NetCDF format, it will return a NetCDF file for each station of the selected province with station informations and ECCC Short Duration Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Data from Table 1: Annual Maximum (mm).

## Examples

### CSV

Let's say someone wants to extract IDF data for Prince Edward Island (PE) in CSV format in the present working directory:

```julia
