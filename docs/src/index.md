# IDFDataCanada.jl

*IDFDataCanada.jl* offers methods to get ECCC IDF data in CSV (`.csv`) or NetCDF (`.nc`) format from the `.txt` files via automatic download and extraction from `.zip` archives on ECCC's [server](https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/climate/Engineer_Climate/IDF/).

### Ouput Format

#### CSV

By choosing CSV format, it will return a `.csv` file for each station of the selected province with ECCC Short Duration Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Data from Table 1: Annual Maximum (mm).

|Ann√©e  |5min   |10min  |15min  |30min  |1h      |2h      |6h    |12h   |24h   |
|:-----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|-----:|
|      |        |        |        |        |         |         |       |       |      |

Stations information is returned in a CSV file named `info_stations.csv` :

|Name  |Province|ID      |Lat     |Lon     |Elevation|Number of years|CSV filename|Original filename|
|:-----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:----------:|----------------:|
|      |        |        |        |        |         |               |            |                 |

#### NetCDF

By choosing NetCDF format, it will return a `.nc` file for each station of the selected province with station informations and ECCC Short Duration Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Data from Table 1: Annual Maximum (mm).
